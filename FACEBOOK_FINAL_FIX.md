# Facebook Posting - Final Solution

## 🔴 Problem

1. **Invalid Permissions:** `pages_manage_posts` and `pages_read_engagement` are invalid scopes
2. **Posting Error:** Facebook requires `pages_read_engagement` permission to post
3. **Catch-22:** Can't request the permission, but need it to post

## ✅ Solution

The page access token from `/me/accounts` should have publishing permissions by default for pages you own/manage. However, Facebook might be checking for app-level permissions.

### Option 1: Use Page Token (Current Approach)

The page token we get should work. The error might be because:
- The token doesn't have the right permissions
- Facebook is checking app-level permissions
- We need to verify token permissions

### Option 2: Request Permission via App Review

For production use, you may need to:
1. Go to Facebook Developer Console
2. Submit app for review
3. Request `pages_read_engagement` or `pages_manage_posts` permission
4. Provide use case and privacy policy

### Option 3: Use Alternative Approach

Check if we can:
- Use user access token directly with page ID
- Request token with explicit permissions
- Use different API endpoint

## 🔍 Debugging Steps

### 1. Check Token Permissions

Go to: https://developers.facebook.com/tools/debug/accesstoken/

1. Get your page access token from the database
2. Paste it into the debugger
3. Check what permissions it has
4. See if it has publishing permissions

### 2. Verify Page Ownership

1. Go to: https://www.facebook.com/pages/manage
2. Verify you're an admin of the page
3. Check page roles and permissions

### 3. Test with Graph API Explorer

1. Go to: https://developers.facebook.com/tools/explorer/
2. Select your app
3. Get page access token
4. Test posting with: `POST /{page-id}/feed`
5. See what error you get

## 📝 Current Status

- ✅ OAuth connection works (with `pages_show_list`)
- ✅ Page token obtained from `/me/accounts`
- ❌ Posting fails: Requires `pages_read_engagement`
- ❌ Permission invalid in OAuth scope

## 🔧 Next Steps

1. **Check token permissions** using debugger
2. **Test with Graph API Explorer** to see exact error
3. **Consider app review** if needed for production
4. **Check if page token needs refresh** with different permissions

---

## ⚠️ Important Note

For pages you own/manage, the page token should have publishing permissions by default. The error might be:
- Facebook checking app-level permissions (even though token has them)
- Need to verify token has correct permissions
- May need app review for production use

**Check token permissions first, then we can decide the next step!** 🔍
