# ðŸŽ¨ Cloudinary Setup Guide

## Overview
Cloudinary is used to store and serve images for your social media posts. It provides:
- Fast CDN delivery
- Automatic image optimization
- Generous free tier (25GB storage, 25GB bandwidth/month)

## Step 1: Create Cloudinary Account

1. Go to https://cloudinary.com/users/register_free
2. Sign up with your email or Google account
3. Verify your email address

## Step 2: Get Your Credentials

Once logged in to Cloudinary dashboard:

1. Click on the **Dashboard** link in the top navigation
2. You'll see your account details section with:
   - **Cloud Name**: Your unique identifier (e.g., `dv7x8mync`)
   - **API Key**: Your public API key (e.g., `123456789012345`)
   - **API Secret**: Your private API secret (e.g., `AbCd1234...`) - Click "Reveal" to show it

3. Copy these three values

## Step 3: Add to .env File

Open your `.env` file and add these lines:

```bash
# Cloudinary (Image Storage & CDN)
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloud_name_here
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_api_secret_here
```

Replace the placeholder values with your actual credentials:

```bash
# Example (use your real values)
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=dv7x8mync
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=123456789012345
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=AbCdEfGh1234567890AbCdEfGh1234
```

## Step 4: Add to Railway (Production)

For your Railway production deployment:

1. Go to https://railway.app/dashboard
2. Select your project
3. Click on your service
4. Click **Variables** tab
5. Click **+ New Variable** and add:
   - `CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME` = your cloud name
   - `CLOUDINARY_API_KEY` = your API key
   - `CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET` = your API secret
6. Railway will automatically redeploy with new variables

## Step 5: Test the Integration

1. Restart your local server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

2. Go to http://localhost:3000/dashboard

3. Try uploading an image:
   - Click the image upload area
   - Select an image (JPG, PNG, or GIF)
   - You should see a loading spinner, then preview

4. Check Cloudinary dashboard:
   - Go to **Media Library** in Cloudinary
   - You should see a folder `social-media-automator/[your-user-id]`
   - Your uploaded image will be there

## What Happens When You Upload

1. **User uploads** image from their computer
2. **Backend receives** file via Multer
3. **Cloudinary** receives file and:
   - Optimizes image quality
   - Resizes to max 1200x630px (social media optimized)
   - Converts to best format (WebP, etc.)
   - Stores in your account
4. **Backend receives** secure URL from Cloudinary
5. **Frontend displays** preview using Cloudinary URL
6. **Post is created** with Cloudinary URL
7. **Platforms receive** image from Cloudinary CDN

## Image Organization

Images are organized by user ID:
```
social-media-automator/
  â””â”€â”€ user-id-1/
      â”œâ”€â”€ image1.jpg
      â”œâ”€â”€ image2.png
      â””â”€â”€ ...
  â””â”€â”€ user-id-2/
      â”œâ”€â”€ image1.jpg
      â””â”€â”€ ...
```

This keeps each user's images separate and makes it easy to:
- Track usage per user
- Delete user data if needed
- Organize by folders

## Free Tier Limits

Cloudinary's free tier includes:
- âœ… **25 GB** storage

## Optimization Features
