## üöÄ NEXT STEPS - Complete These Now

### Step 1: Get Service Role Key from Supabase

1. Go to: https://app.supabase.com/project/gzchblilbthkfuxqhoyo/settings/api
2. Scroll down to **"Service role"** section
3. Click "Reveal" to see the `service_role` key (it's secret!)
4. Copy the key (starts with `eyJ...`)

### Step 2: Create Your .env File

Run these commands in your terminal:

```bash
# Copy the template
cp ENV_TEMPLATE.txt .env

# Now edit .env and replace SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY with the real key you just copied
```

**Your .env should have these Supabase values:**
```bash
SUPABASE_URL=https://gzchblilbthkfuxqhoyo.supabase.co
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJzdXBhYmFzZSIsInJlZiI6Imd6Y2hibGlsYnRoa2Z1eHFob3lvIiwicm9sZSI6ImFub24iLCJpYXQiOjE3NjEzMDgzOTcsImV4cCI6MjA3Njg4NDM5N30.h85XUXsVvxYAdMA9odgO4W5RN1148MDOO86XhwgOnb8
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=<paste the service_role key here>
```

### Step 3: Test Authentication Locally

```bash
# Start the server
npm start

# Server should show:
# ‚úÖ Supabase Auth configured
# üöÄ Server running on http://localhost:3000
```

Then test:
1. Open http://localhost:3000 (landing page)
2. Click "Start Free" or go to http://localhost:3000/auth
3. Try signing up with email/password
4. Check your email for verification link
5. After verification, sign in
6. You should be redirected to http://localhost:3000/dashboard
7. Dashboard should show your email in the navbar

- Check browser console for errors
- Make sure `authToken` is being set in dashboard.html

### Can't sign up / "Invalid email" error
- Check Supabase email settings
- Make sure email confirmation is configured
- Try with a real email address

### Verification email not received
- Check Supabase > Authentication > Email Templates
- Check your spam folder
- Try using Mailtrap or another email testing service

### Server shows "Supabase Auth not configured"
- Make sure `.env` file exists
- Make sure SUPABASE_URL and SUPABASE_ANON_KEY are set in `.env`
- Restart the server after creating `.env`

## üìù What's Working Now

‚úÖ **Frontend Auth**: Login/Signup forms with real Supabase connection
‚úÖ **Dashboard Protection**: Redirects to /auth if not logged in
‚úÖ **JWT Verification**: All API endpoints verify user tokens
‚úÖ **Database Migration**: Multi-tenant tables created
‚úÖ **RLS Policies**: Users can only see their own data

---

## üéØ What's Next After Auth Works

1. **OAuth Setup**: Connect LinkedIn and Twitter accounts
2. **Stripe Integration**: Set up billing and subscriptions
3. **Test Multi-Tenant Features**: Create posts as different users
4. **Deploy to Production**: Railway deployment with env vars

---

## üÜò Need Help?

If anything doesn't work:
1. Check browser console for JavaScript errors
2. Check server logs for backend errors
3. Verify Supabase credentials are correct
4. Make sure the database migration ran successfully
5. Test with `curl` to isolate frontend vs backend issues

Example curl test:
```bash
# Test health endpoint (should work)
curl http://localhost:3000/api/health

# Test protected endpoint (should fail without token)
curl http://localhost:3000/api/accounts
```
