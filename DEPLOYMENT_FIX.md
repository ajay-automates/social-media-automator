# ðŸ”§ Dashboard Deployment Fix

## Problem
Production URL returns "Not Found" when accessing `/dashboard/` route.

## Root Cause
Railway wasn't building the React dashboard before deploying the app. The `dashboard/dist` folder was missing in production.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Added Build Script
Updated `package.json` to include a build script:
```json
"scripts": {
  "build": "cd dashboard && npm install && npm run build && cd ..",
  "start": "node server.js",
  "dev": "nodemon server.js"
}
```

### 2. Created Railway Configuration
Added `railway.json` to configure the build process:
```json
{
  "$schema": "https://railway.app/railway.schema.json",
  "build": {
    "builder": "NIXPACKS",
    "buildCommand": "npm run build"
  },
  "deploy": {
    "startCommand": "npm start",
    "restartPolicyType": "ON_FAILURE",
    "restartPolicyMaxRetries": 10
  }
}
```

### 3. Enhanced Error Handling
Updated `server.js` to:
- Check if dashboard dist folder exists
- Check if index.html exists
- Log helpful error messages
- Provide fallback responses

## What Happens Now

1. Railway detects the build script in package.json
2. Builds the dashboard by running `npm run build`
3. Compiles React app to `dashboard/dist/`
4. Starts the server with `npm start`
5. Server serves the dashboard from the dist folder

## Testing

After Railway redeploys:
- Visit: https://capable-motivation-production-7a75.up.railway.app/dashboard/
- Should load the React dashboard
- Login flow should work
- All features should be accessible

## Files Changed
- `package.json`: Added build script
- `railway.json`: Created Railway config
- `server.js`: Enhanced error handling
- All commits pushed to GitHub

## Status
âœ… Build script added
âœ… Railway config created
âœ… Error handling improved
âœ… Changes pushed to production

Awaiting Railway to redeploy with the build step.
