**Root Cause**: The callback URL in your LinkedIn app settings doesn't match what the server is sending.

### Issue 2: Twitter - Callback completes but nothing happens
**Problem**: After authorizing on Twitter, redirects back but nothing happens.

**Root Cause**: Callback endpoint might be failing silently or not redirecting properly.

   - Should be: `https://...` ‚úÖ

3. **Different domain**: Using localhost or staging URL ‚ùå
   - Should be: Production Railway URL ‚úÖ
