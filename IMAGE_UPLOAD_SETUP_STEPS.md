## 📋 Steps to Complete Setup

### Step 1: Add Cloudinary Credentials to .env

1. If you already have Cloudinary account credentials, add them to your `.env` file:

```bash
# Add these lines to your .env file
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloud_name_here
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_api_secret_here
```

2. If you DON'T have a Cloudinary account yet:
   - See `CLOUDINARY_SETUP.md` for detailed instructions
   - It takes 2 minutes to sign up and get credentials

### Step 2: Run Database Migration

1. Open Supabase SQL Editor: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/gzchblilbthkfuxqhoyo/sql

2. Copy and paste the contents of:
   ```
   migrations/005_add_image_support.sql
   ```

3. Click "Run" to execute the migration

4. This adds:
   - `image_url` column to store Cloudinary URLs
   - `image_source` column to track upload source
   - Performance index

### Step 3: Restart Local Server

```bash
# Stop current server (Ctrl+C)
# Then restart:
npm start
```

### Step 4: Test Locally

1. Go to http://localhost:3000/dashboard

2. Try uploading an image:
   - Click the upload area (or drag & drop)
   - Select an image (JPG, PNG, GIF)
   - See it upload and preview

3. Create a post with the image:
   - Write some text
   - Image should be attached
   - Post to LinkedIn and/or Twitter

4. Check:
   - ✅ LinkedIn post shows image
   - ✅ Twitter post shows image
   - ✅ Image appears in Cloudinary dashboard

### Step 5: Deploy to Railway

1. Add Cloudinary credentials to Railway:
   ```bash
   # Go to Railway dashboard → Variables → Add:
   CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloud_name
   CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_api_key
   CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_api_secret
   ```

2. Commit and push all changes:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add image upload functionality with Cloudinary"
   git push origin main
   ```

3. Railway will auto-deploy

4. Test in production:
   - Go to your Railway URL
   - Upload an image
   - Post to platforms

## 📊 Technical Details

### File Flow:
```
User's Computer
    ↓ (multipart/form-data)
Express Server (Multer)
    ↓ (temp file)
Cloudinary Service
    ↓ (upload + optimize)
Cloudinary CDN
    ↓ (secure URL)
Database (post.image_url)
    ↓
LinkedIn/Twitter APIs
```

### Image Optimization:
- Max dimensions: 1200x630px (social media optimized)
- Quality: Auto (Cloudinary AI chooses best)
- Format: Auto (WebP for modern browsers, JPG fallback)
- Organized by user ID in folders

### Security:
- File type validation (images only)
- File size validation (10MB max)
- User authentication required
- API secret never exposed to frontend
- Images stored per-user with isolated folders

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "No authorization token" error
- Make sure you're logged in
- Token might be expired, try logging out and back in

### "Image too large" error
- File must be under 10MB
- Try compressing the image first

### "Upload failed" error
- Check Cloudinary credentials in .env
- Verify credentials are correct (no spaces/quotes)
- Check server logs for specific error

### Image doesn't appear in post
- Check network tab for 404 errors
- Verify Cloudinary URL is accessible
- Check platform API responses for errors

### Railway deployment issues
- Make sure all env vars are set in Railway
- Check Railway logs for errors
- Verify uploads directory is created
